Firstly, I had to look up the "crime scene report" table and filter the date, city and type of murder based on what I remembered using the query below;

[
select * from crime_scene_report
where date = 20180115 AND city = 'SQL City' AND type = 'murder'
]

Fortunately, there was a description in the report which says "Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave". From here, I got a hint on the witness' addresses and the first name of one of the witnesses.
I decided to look up the address of the first witness who lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr" from the "person" table using the query below;

[
select * from person
where address_street_name ='Northwestern Dr'
order by address_number desc
limit 1
]

I did the same for the second witness using the query below;

[
select * from person
where address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave'
AND name like '%Annabel%'
]

From the "person" table, I got information on their id and decided to check it up in the "interview" table using the query below;
 
[
select * from interview
where person_id in (16371,14887)
]

Here, I got a lot of information about the case from both interviews. These are the responses from the witnesses; 

First witness - I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".

Second witness - I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.

According to the first witness, I checked the "get_fit_now_check_in" table and "get_fit_now_member" table, I filtered the membership status as "gold" and check in date as told by the second witness. I also checked if there was an existing membership number that started with '48Z' using the code below;

[
SELECT * from get_fit_now_check_in
join get_fit_now_member
ON get_fit_now_check_in.membership_id = get_fit_now_member.id
where membership_status = 'gold' and check_in_date = 20180109
and id like '48Z%'
]

Unfortunately, i got two members with similar membership id and also with same membership status. The first witness said he saw a car with a plate that included "H42W", I checked that up in the "driver’s_license" table using the code below;

[
select * from driver’s license
where plate number like "%H42W%"
]

I found three plate numbers with "H42W" included, then I decided to look at their ids in the "person" table using this code below;

[
select * from person 
where license id in (183779, 423327, 664760)
]

Here, i found a name that appeared on both sides and was already my suspect. I checked the person id from the "interview" using the code below;

[
select * from interview
where person id = 67318
]

It turned out i wan correct, this is what i found in the description;

I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017

Getting the woman
According to the killer's description, I was able to find some useful information about the woman using the code below;

[
select count(person_id), person_id from  facebook_event_checkin
where event_name =  "SQL Symphony Concert"
and date like "%201712%"
group by person_id
order by count(person_id) desc
]

I found three people that fits well in this description and decided to make advance research by viewing the "facebook_event_chekin" table to check who has attended thrice using the code below;

[
select count(person_id), person_id from  facebook_event_checkin
where event_name =  "SQL Symphony Concert"
and date like "%201712%"
group by person_id
order by count(person_id) desc
]

Unfortunately, i found out that only two people attended the concert thrice. So i decided to check up their names using their id in the "person" table using the code below;

[
select * from person
where id in (99716, 24556)
]

Yes, i found a correlating license_id on both sides and that for sure is the Woman.
